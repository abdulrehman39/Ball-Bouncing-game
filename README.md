# Ball Bouncing Game

This repository showcases a Python-based ball bouncing game, designed to compare the performance of different Large Language Models (LLMs). Each model was provided with the same prompt, and their generated code was tested and analyzed for accuracy and efficiency.

## Prompt Used

plaintext
Write a Python program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The ball should be affected by gravity and friction, and it must bounce off the rotating walls realistically.

## Project Overview

- Developed a ball bouncing game in Python.
- Compared and analyzed code generated by different LLMs.
- Evaluated the accuracy, efficiency, and realism of each implementation.

## Repository Contents

- **Generated Code:** Python scripts created by various LLMs.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ball-Bouncing-Game.git
   cd Ball-Bouncing-Game
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if required):
3. Run the game script:

## Purpose of the Project

This project serves as an exploration of AI-generated code, assessing how well different LLMs handle structured game development tasks. By comparing their outputs, we gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applicability.
